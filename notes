📘 Introduction of Python
Python is a high-level programming language used to perform tasks by giving instructions to the computer.
Python is easy to learn and simple to use, especially for beginners.
One of the main advantages of Python is that we do not need to declare data types explicitly.
Python automatically identifies the data type based on the value assigned.
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum.
Python is an independent programming language, which means we do not need to learn any other language before learning Python.

Python is widely used in many fields such as:
Web Development
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Machine Learning (ML)
Data Science
Automation
Python can also integrate easily with other programming languages, tools, and technologies, which makes it very powerful and popular.

💻 IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software tool used to write, run, and debug programs easily.
Python development, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is one of the most commonly used IDEs.
VS Code itself is a lightweight tool, but it becomes powerful by installing extensions.

VS Code Extensions for Python
Python Extension
Used to write, execute, and debug Python programs
Provides features like syntax highlighting and error checking

Extension
Used to work with Jupyter Notebooks
Helpful for data analysis, visualization, and experimentation
By using these extensions, VS Code becomes a complete environment for Python application development.

🧾 Variables in Python
A variable is used to store data (values) in a program.
Computers cannot remember a value for a long time unless it is stored.
So, we use variables to store values and reuse them whenever needed.
When we assign a value to a variable once, we can retrieve (reuse) the same value multiple times in the program without typing it again.
Example
x = 10
Here, x is a variable that stores the value 10.
We can use x anywhere in the program to get the same value.

Why we use variables
To store data
To reuse values
To make programs easy to read and understand
To avoid repeating the same value again and again

🧾 Types of Variables in Python
Python lo variables scope & location prakaram classify chestaru.

1. Local Variable
Where Defined: Inside a function/method of a class
Scope: Only inside that function
Usage: Temporary data for the function

Example:
class Student:
    def show(self):
        x = 10   # local variable
        print(x)

student1 = Student()
student1.show()  # Output: 10
# print(x) → Error

2. Global Variable
Where Defined: Outside all classes and functions
Scope: Can be used anywhere in the program
Example:
x = 20  # global variable

class Student:
    def show(self):
        print(x)  # can use global variable

student1 = Student()
student1.show()  # Output: 20

3. Instance Variable
Where Defined: Inside class using self
Scope: Unique for each object
Usage: Object-specific data
Example:

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # instance variable
        self.age = age    # instance variable

student1 = Student("Devi", 22)
student2 = Student("Ravi", 25)

print(student1.name)  # Devi
print(student2.name)  # Ravi

4. Class Variable
Where Defined: Inside class but outside all functions
Scope: Shared by all objects of the class
Usage: Common data for all objects

Example:

class Student:
    college = "ABC College"  # class variable

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name     # instance variable

student1 = Student("Devi")
student2 = Student("Ravi")

print(student1.college)  # ABC College
print(student2.college)  # ABC College

Variable Type                        	Defined                                 Where	Scope/Usage
Local Variable	                Inside class function/method	               Only inside that function
Global Variable	                Outside all classes & functions             	Anywhere in program
Instance Variable            	  Inside class                                  using self	Unique for each object
Class Variable	                Inside class, outside functions             	Shared by all objects of class

💡 Shortcut for memory
Local → function only
Global → anywhere
Instance → per object
Class → shared by all objects ✅

🔹 Python Built-in (Default) Functions
Definition: Functions which are already available in Python and can be used directly without defining them.
Purpose: Perform common tasks quickly without writing extra code.
Example: type(), len(), print(), input(), int(), str(), sum() etc.

1. type() Function
Purpose: Returns the data type of a variable or value.
Syntax:
type(object)

Example:

x = 10
y = "Devi"

print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'str'>

Other Common Built-in Functions
Function	           Purpose	                       Example
len()	       Returns length of object	             len("Hello") → 5
print()	       Displays output on screen	         print("Hi")
input()	       Takes input from user	          name = input("Enter: ")
int()	       Converts value to integer	      int("10") → 10
str()	       Converts value to string	          str(10) → "10"
sum()	      Returns sum of iterable elements	  sum([1,2,3]) → 6

Notebook Shortcut
Built-in functions → Already available in Python
No need to define, can use directly
Examples: type(), len(), print(), input(), int(), str(), sum()

🧾 Rules to Create Variables in Python
When creating a variable in Python, you must follow these rules:

1. Variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_)
name = "Devi"   # ✅ valid
_age = 22       # ✅ valid
1age = 22       # ❌ invalid, cannot start with a number

2. Variable name can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
student1 = "Ravi"   # ✅ valid
total_marks = 100   # ✅ valid
total-marks = 100   # ❌ invalid, cannot use hyphen (-)

3. Variable names are case-sensitive
age = 22
Age = 30
print(age)  # 22
print(Age)  # 30
age and Age are different variables

4. Variable names cannot be Python keywords
Keywords are reserved words in Python like:
if, for, while, class, def, return etc.

class = "Devi"   # ❌ invalid

5. Variable names cannot contain spaces
student name = "Ravi"  # ❌ invalid
student_name = "Ravi"  # ✅ valid

6. Recommended Practice
Use meaningful names
Use lowercase letters with underscores for readability
total_marks = 100
student_name = "Devi"

🧾 Python Data Structures
Add → append / add
Delete → pop / del / remove
Update → change using index or key ✅

1. List
Ordered collection → items keep the same order you add them
Mutable → you can change, add, or remove items
allow dublicates

Example:
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

# Accessing items
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Adding items
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)     # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'orange']

# Changing items
fruits[1] = "grapes"
print(fruits)     # Output: ['apple', 'grapes', 'mango', 'orange']

Remove in List  
Python lists lo items remove cheyadaniki main methods:
remove(value) → specified value remove chestundi
pop(index) → specified index item remove chestundi (default last item)
del → index or full list delete cheyadaniki

Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "orange"]

# Remove by value
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'mango', 'orange']

# Remove by index
fruits.pop(1)
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange']

# Delete item using del
del fruits[0]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['orange']

# Delete full list
# del fruits
# print(fruits)  # ❌ Error, list deleted(value) → specified value remove chestundi
pop(index) → specified index item remove chestundi (default last item)
del → index or full list delete cheyadaniki

Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "orange"]

# Remove by value
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'mango', 'orange']

# Remove by index
fruits.pop(1)
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange']

# Delete item using del
del fruits[0]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['orange']

# Delete full list
# del fruits
# print(fruits)  # ❌ Error, list deleted

1️⃣ Creating a List Manually
We can create a list by directly writing values inside square brackets [ ].
Example:
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(l)

Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
👉 This method is used when we already know the values.

2️⃣ Creating a List Using list() Function
We can also create a list using the built-in list() function.
Example:
l = "data structure"
print(list(l))
Output:
['d', 'a', 't', 'a', ' ', 's', 't', 'r', 'u', 'c', 't', 'u', 'r', 'e']
👉 Here, the list() function converts each character of the string into a list element.

2. Tuple
Ordered collection → items keep order
Immutable → you cannot change the items after creation

Example:
# Creating a tuple
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Accessing items
print(numbers[2])  # Output: 3

# Tuples are immutable
# numbers[1] = 10  # ❌ This will give an error

3. Set
Unordered collection → items have no specific order
Unique elements only → duplicates are not allowed.
in set we can add and remove but we cannot modify the existing data /update the data
Example:
# Creating a set
colors = {"red", "green", "blue", "red"}  # 'red' duplicate

print(colors)  # Output: {'blue', 'red', 'green'} → duplicates removed

# Adding items
colors.add("yellow")
print(colors)  # Output: {'blue', 'red', 'green', 'yellow'}

Remove in Set
Sets lo .remove() or .discard() use cheyachu
Difference: remove() → error if item not present, discard() → no error
Example:
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}

# Remove using remove()
colors.remove("green")
print(colors)  # Output: {'red', 'blue'}

# Remove using discard() (safe)
colors.discard("yellow")  # No error even if 'yellow' not present
print(colors)  # Output: {'red', 'blue'}

4. Dictionary
Key-value pairs → each value is accessed by a key
Unordered → no fixed order for items
keys are immutable only values are mutable.
keys are used to call values.
keys doesn't allow dupilicate.
Example:

# Creating a dictionary
student = {"name": "Devi", "age": 22, "course": "Python"}

# Accessing value using key
print(student["name"])  # Output: Devi

# Adding new key-value pair
student["college"] = "ABC College"
print(student)

# Changing value
student["age"] = 23
print(student)

Remove in Dictionary
Dictionary lo key-value pair remove cheyali ante del or .pop() use chestaru
Example:
student = {"name": "Devi", "age": 22, "course": "Python"}

# Remove using del
del student["course"]
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'Devi', 'age': 22}

# Remove using pop()
student.pop("age")
print(student)  # Output: {'name': 'Devi'}

🟦 PYTHON CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS (IF – ELSE)
🔹 What is if–else?
if-else is used to check a condition and execute code based on the result.
If condition is True → if block executes
If condition is False → else block executes

🔹 1. IF – ELSE
Definition:
if-else is used when there is only one condition to check.

Syntax:
if condition:
    statement
else:
    statement

Example:
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Not eligible")

🔹 2. IF – ELIF – ELSE
Definition:
if-elif-else is used when multiple decisions / conditions are required.

Working:
First if condition is checked
If false → elif conditions are checked one by one
If all conditions are false → else block executes

Syntax:
if condition1:
    statement
elif condition2:
    statement
elif condition3:
    statement
else:
    statement

Example:
marks = 65

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 70:
    print("Grade B")
elif marks >= 35:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")

🔹 3. NESTED IF
Definition:
Nested if means if statement inside another if statement.
When to use:
When a condition depends on another condition.

Syntax:
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        statement
    else:
        statement
else:
    statement

Example:
age = 20
id_card = True

if age >= 18:
    if id_card == True:
        print("Allowed to vote")
    else:
        print("ID card required")
else:
    print("Not eligible")

🔹 Comparison Operators
Operator	                Meaning
==	                        Equal
!=	                        Not equal
>	                        Greater than
<	                        Less than
>=	                        Greater than or equal
<=	                        Less than or equal

🔹 Logical Operators
Operator	                    Use
and	                      Both conditions must be true
or	                      Any one condition true
not	                      Reverse the condition
 
🔹 Important Rules
✔ Colon : is mandatory
✔ Indentation (spaces) is very important
✔ else does not have a condition
✔ Python checks conditions top to bottom

🧠 Short Summary
if–else → single condition
if–elif–else → multiple conditions
nested if → condition inside condition

🟦 PYTHON LOOPS – FOR LOOP & WHILE LOOP
🔹 What is a Loop?
A loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times.

🔵 FOR LOOP
👉 Definition:
for loop is used to iterate over a sequence like list, tuple, string, or range.

👉 Key Points:
for loop ki direct condition undadu
Loop sequence values meeda depend avutundi
Enni times iterate avutundo mundey easy ga telustundi
Iterations fixed & predictable

👉 Syntax:
for variable in sequence:
    statement

👉 Example:
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)

👉 Explanation:

Range(1,6) → values: 1,2,3,4,5
Loop 5 times run avutundi
Iterations easy ga predict cheyyachu

🔵 WHILE LOOP
👉 Definition:
while loop is used to execute code while a condition is true.

👉 Key Points:
while loop ki condition compulsory
Loop condition meeda depend avutundi
Exact ga enni times iterate avutundo mundey teliyadu
Increment / decrement compulsory
Careful ga use cheyyali (infinite loop chance)

👉 Syntax:
while condition:
    statement

👉 Example:
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

👉 Dynamic Example:
password = ""

while password != "admin":
    password = input("Enter password")


👉 User input meeda depend
👉 Loop enni times run avutundo predict cheyyalem

🔥 FOR LOOP vs WHILE LOOP (Difference)

FOR LOOP	                                          WHILE LOOP
Condition undadu	                             Condition compulsory
Sequence based	                                 Condition based
Iterations known                             	Iterations unknown
Predictable                                 	Not predictable
Safe & easy	                                   Infinite loop risk

🧠 Easy Remember Lines (Strong 💡)
For loop → iterations count mundey telustundi
While loop → iterations count mundey teliyadu
For → fixed values
While → dynamic condition

✨ One-Line Definitions (Exam Ready)
For loop: Used when number of iterations is known
While loop: Used when number of iterations is unknown

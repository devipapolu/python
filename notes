📘 Introduction of Python
Python is a high-level programming language used to perform tasks by giving instructions to the computer.
Python is easy to learn and simple to use, especially for beginners.
One of the main advantages of Python is that we do not need to declare data types explicitly.
Python automatically identifies the data type based on the value assigned.
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum.
Python is an independent programming language, which means we do not need to learn any other language before learning Python.

Python is widely used in many fields such as:
Web Development
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Machine Learning (ML)
Data Science
Automation
Python can also integrate easily with other programming languages, tools, and technologies, which makes it very powerful and popular.

💻 IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software tool used to write, run, and debug programs easily.
Python development, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is one of the most commonly used IDEs.
VS Code itself is a lightweight tool, but it becomes powerful by installing extensions.

VS Code Extensions for Python
Python Extension
Used to write, execute, and debug Python programs
Provides features like syntax highlighting and error checking

Extension
Used to work with Jupyter Notebooks
Helpful for data analysis, visualization, and experimentation
By using these extensions, VS Code becomes a complete environment for Python application development.
